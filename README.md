# 🚤 RC Boat Project

A fully **SolidWorks-designed**, 3D-printed remote-controlled boat developed from concept to functional prototype.  
This project demonstrates **mechanical design, system integration, materials selection, and engineering tradeoff analysis**.

## ✨ Features
- Fully **designed in SolidWorks**, including hull geometry, motor mount, rudder, and steering mechanisms  
- Fully **3D-printed hull and custom components**, assembled into a functional RC boat  
- **Waterproofed structure** using epoxy and fiberglass for durability and water resistance  
- **Arduino-based control system** for propulsion and steering using servo motors  
- Evaluated two propulsion system architectures:
  - **ESC-based system** (final implementation)
  - **Motor driver module-based system** (alternative approach)
- Performed **cost and performance comparison** between propulsion systems, achieving a **26% cost reduction** using the motor driver approach while maintaining functional requirements

## 🧪 Engineering Focus

This project was used to:
- Design and validate a **complete electromechanical system** from scratch  
- Compare alternative propulsion architectures based on **cost, complexity, and performance**  
- Validate mechanical fit, waterproofing, and system reliability through hands-on testing  
- Apply iterative design updates based on test results and assembly feedback

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Add onboard sensors for performance monitoring  
- Improve hull efficiency and weight distribution  
- Refine waterproofing and sealing methods  
- Add live telemetry for diagnostics
